				<h2>Expense Tracker </h2>
				<hr>
				<p> In this modern age of ubiquotous computing, it can be said that modern information and communicatioin technology is already part
				of the basic human needs. With increasing economy and salary, the middle class is able to afford nice gadgets and travel to new places.
				Unforunately, the prizes of real estate bloats up as well. In order to ensure that we are saving enough, we need to track our expenses. </p>
				
				<p> This Web application will allow users to store their expenses and review them at a later time. The timestamp for each entry will
					be automatically recorded. Analysis tools will be made available for reviewing the current database of expenses such as 
					data grouping and filtering, statistical regressions, and charts.</p>
				
				<h2> How to use </h2>
				<hr>
				<p> To start using this application, log in now. In the future, multiple users will be supported. To enter an expense, press the <strong> INPUT tab. </strong> 
				To review the current expense database, press the <strong>VIEW tab</strong>. </p>
				
				<h2> Implementation details </h2>
				<hr>
				<p> The web page and its design is handcrafted using HTML and CSS, and Javascript is used to add interactive effects. Furthermore, I will be 
				using JS to create place holder functions as I add features on the web application. A MySQL Server is used to store the expense database. SQL
				table queries will be utilized in viewing the current expense entries</p>
