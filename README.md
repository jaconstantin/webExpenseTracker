# webExpenseTracker

This project deals with the creation of a Web Based Expense Tracker Program. The objective is to allow different users to log in to their account, start recording their expense data, and view them at a later time. In contrast to the C++ version of this project, an HTML/CSS/javascript web page will be used as the UI for this project. A MySQL server will be at the backend of this application to store all data.  Furthermore, I am planning to use the query capabilities of MySQL in returning/summarizing/grouping a large amount of expenditure data. I am also planning to use Python or Django for the server side scripting, and maybe add chart/plot capabilities in the future.

  Current Progress
----------------------
This project is at the early stage of its development. I am still working on the Web Page for the project. Currently, it features a decent amount of interactivity in the HOME and INPUT page. I have also built user input checking on javascript. I have the MySQL server and scripts up and running, but is currently not uploaded here. I will continue to log the changes here until the completion of the project.
